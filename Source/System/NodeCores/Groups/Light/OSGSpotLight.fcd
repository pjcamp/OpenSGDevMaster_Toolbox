  SpotLight is a located lightsource. The position of the light source
  (in the beacon's coordinate system) is defined by the \c position
  attribute, its direction by the \c direction attribute. The spot has an
  exponential fallof, controlled by the \c spotExponent attribute and a
  maximum opening angle, defined by the \c spotCutOff attribute.
  The influence of the light diminishes with distance, controlled
  by the \c constantAttenuation, \c linearAttenuation and \c
  quadraticAttenuation attributes.
